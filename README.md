📌 Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world customer support environment using the power of CrewAI, a framework designed to build collaborative AI agent teams. Each agent in this system performs a unique role to efficiently handle customer queries and deliver fast, accurate support.

🧠 System Agents & Their Roles
🧑‍🔧 Technical Support Agent
Handles technical issues such as troubleshooting errors, guiding installations, resolving connectivity problems, and helping users navigate technical obstacles related to the product.

💰 Billing Support Agent
Takes care of all billing and payment-related inquiries including invoice generation, refund requests, subscription upgrades/downgrades, and transaction disputes.

📦 Product Information Agent
Provides detailed information about products such as specifications, usage instructions, feature comparisons, availability, warranty, and customer benefits.

🔁 Escalation Manager
Monitors unresolved or critical queries and ensures smooth escalation to human support or specialized agents. Acts as the fallback mechanism for customer satisfaction assurance.

🤖 Features
✅ Role-based agent delegation

✅ Multi-threaded query handling

✅ Modular tool integration for task completion

✅ Easily extendable architecture

✅ Realistic simulation of customer support workflows
