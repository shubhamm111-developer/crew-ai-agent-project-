## 📌 Project Overview

This is a multi-agent customer support system built using [CrewAI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI). It simulates a real-world customer support team with different roles:

- 🧑‍🔧 Technical Support Agent
- 💰 Billing Support Agent
- 📦 Product Information Agent
- 🔁 Escalation Manager

Each agent has a specific role and can delegate tasks using tools.
all codes and agents are present in main folder
